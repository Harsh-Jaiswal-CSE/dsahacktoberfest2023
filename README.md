Contributing & Guidelines üëÄ Contributions are always welcome!

Make sure you have followed me on GitHub and starred this repository. Although this is not mandatory, doing so really motivates me to keep making more awesome content.

By contributing to this project, you adhere to this project's code of conduct. They are as follows:-

Your code must be properly formatted. The code you contribute you must be your own. Your code must be error and bug free. File structure must be proper. You must write the code for a particular language in that particular folder. For example, write Java code in the Java folder and Python code in Python folder, etc. Inside a folder, write the program in a subfolder for that particular topic. For example, write Array programs in Array folder, Linked List programs in LinkedList folder, etc. Make sure you exclude the auto-generated files by adding them in .gitignore. Do not spam. Note: The maintainers of this repository may not accept your changes if they do not meet our standards.

How to Contribute üë®‚Äçüíª Before contributing, make sure you have read the contribution guidelines above. Failing to meet our standards, your contributions will not be merged. With that out of the way, let's get our hands dirty by writing some code.

Go to the folder where you want to clone this project then do the following.

Clone the project

git clone git@github.com:adarshpand3y/hacktoberfest2023-DSA.git . Open the folder in the code editor of your choice and make the changes.

Stage the changes

git add . Commit the changes

git commit -m "Your commit message here" Push the changes to github

git push Once you have successfully pushed the project, open GitHub and click on the dropdown next to Contribute and click on Open pull request.

After that, write a message and a comment (optional). Then click on Create pull request.

Tech Stack ‚ú® We do not limit your knowledge. Hence we accept all programming languages. You should, however, write your code for a particular language in a that particular folder. In case a folder does not exist for a particular language, create one. Failing to do so will result in your pull request getting rejected.

If you are a beginner and do not know which language to get started with, C, C++, Java or Python is recommended. These are some standard languages to start your programming journey.

Note: You must add the corresponding auto-generated file in the .gitignore file.
